  ## Description
  This project is a command-line application designed to help developers quickly and easily   generate professional README files for their projects. By taking input from the user through a  series of prompts in the command line, the application creates a well-structured README file.  It ensures that the generated README file contains all of the essential sections, such as  project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution   guidelines, test instructions, and license details.

  This application will assist you as a developer, saving time so that more of your focus can  be put toward developing your project, while also ensuring that your documentation is clear  and professional.
